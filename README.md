# üçä Orange Disease Detection using Deep Learning and Machine Learning

This project focuses on the detection and classification of **orange diseases**, specifically identifying **Citrus Canker**, **Melanose**, and **Healthy** leaves. Leveraging the power of **deep learning** and **machine learning**, the system provides accurate and automated analysis of images for early disease diagnosis.

## üß† What This Project Includes

- Deep Learning Models: CNN, VGG16, ConvNeXtV2
- Machine Learning Models: Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree, MLP
- Real-time image classification using a Tkinter-based GUI
- Visualizations of model performance
- Preprocessing and feature extraction pipeline
- Organized and reusable codebase

## Dataset Description

The dataset is taken from Mendeley Data Website.
Dataset consists of around 8500+ images [5.7GB] of orange diseases and healthy oranges.
