# üçä Orange Disease Detection using Deep Learning and Machine Learning

This project focuses on the detection and classification of **orange diseases**, specifically identifying **Citrus Canker**, **Melanose**, and **Healthy** leaves. Leveraging the power of **deep learning** and **machine learning**, the system provides accurate and automated analysis of images for early disease diagnosis.
